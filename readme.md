# K8S Sample App
There are 2 simple apis under the api folder `system` and `data` services. They are built
on .net 6.0. In the same directory are docker files, and other stuff

## Modular Composition
Terraform consider best practice keeping your modules at max 1 layer deep, and utiize
expressions for nesting, and modules together on a single module. They warn that if you nest modules several layers deep. It becomes difficult to make isolated changes to the the infrastructure layout. 

## Quick Start
The first section here is creating new images in docker hub. If you just want to fire up
the cluster, skip this block.
```
## Get into api directory
cd api

## Find versions you would use
./docker-check.sh

## Data Api where you replace <x> with the next revision number
./run-docker.sh 6.0.1.<x> data

## System Api where you replace <x> with the next revision number
./run-docker.sh 6.0.1.<x> system

```

Now you will need to ensure the terraform config for the module is set to the image
version you wish to see deployed. 
```
## Get into the terraform directory for services
cd develop/services #could also be cd stage/services

nano develop/services/main.tf
# edit the version number for both services, 
# and double check the ip matches $(minikube ip)
# save the file and exit nano
```

Now the Terraform config is ready, you will need to fire up minikube and deploy
```
minikube start

# Deploy
cd develop/services
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
# you will need to type yes
```

# Test the deployment
After creating the services you should be able to get the IP:Port
```
cd ../..
./.test-deploy.sh develop
```

You should see the output of the version from the module. Now you are safe to
destroy everything from minikube and terraform
```
cd develop/services
terraform destroy
minikube delete
```

# Create EKS Cluster and Deploy in AWS
This is walkthrough is using Minikube so everything is happening locally, and it is
free. To run the same apis in AWS by creating an EKS Cluster and deploying to the cluster
[See the aws folder](aws/readme.md)
